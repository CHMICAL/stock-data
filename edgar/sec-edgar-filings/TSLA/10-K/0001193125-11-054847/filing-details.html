us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a
market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. Our Tesla Roadster offers impressive acceleration and performance without producing any tailpipe emissions. The Tesla
Roadster&#146;s proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business and, with design enhancements, will also form the basis for our Model&#160;S sedan which is currently scheduled to begin production in mid-2012. In
addition, we provide services for the development of electric powertrain components and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers as evidenced by our development services and sales of battery packs and chargers to Daimler
AG (Daimler) for its Smart fortwo and A-Class electric vehicles, and our agreement to produce a validated electric powertrain system for Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for use in its RAV4 EV. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers&#146; range and performance expectations
required substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our Tesla Roadster. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and
software engineering. We have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a
broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration. We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through
the production of the Tesla Roadster. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We sell and service our Tesla Roadster though our company-owned sales and service
network. Our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies, better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer
feedback. Our Tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and, as a result, do not require corresponding large floor spaces. We believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership, combined with our product design based on modularity
and common platforms, will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile
manufacturers. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and has a
maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Roadster Sport version can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.7 seconds. The Tesla Roadster has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as determined using the United States
Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s (EPA&#146;s), combined two-cycle city/highway test. Recently, the EPA announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could
result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. The Tesla Roadster has a range that is almost double that of any other commercially released electric vehicle and reportedly set a new world distance
record of 313 miles on a single charge for a production electric car in a rally across Australia as part of the 2009 Global Green Challenge. The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster is $101,500 in the United
States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. The Tesla Roadster is currently in production, and as of
December&#160;31, 2010, we had delivered over 1,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 31 countries, almost all of which were sold in </font></p>

North America and Europe. To date, our customers have driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 9.0&#160;million miles. We have developed extensive software systems to manage
the overall efficiency, safety and controls within our vehicles. Additionally, we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the United Nations, United States Department of Transportation and other government agencies, allowing us to ship
the Tesla Roadster to a number of countries throughout the world. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We announced our second electric vehicle, the Model&#160;S,
with the public exhibition of a drivable early prototype in March 2009. We currently plan to begin production of the Model&#160;S in mid-2012. We are designing the Model&#160;S to be a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional
performance, functionality and attractive styling. As a fully electric vehicle, the Model&#160;S will produce zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds. We currently anticipate
that the base Model&#160;S will have an effective price of $49,900 in the United States with the standard 160 mile battery pack, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of
alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles. We are designing the Model&#160;S to offer a variety of range options from 160 miles
to 300 miles on a single charge, as projected using the EPA&#146;s combined two-cycle city/highway test. The EPA has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe
could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate that
the initial units of the Model S will be introduced with a Signature Series which will include certain colors and options, some of which may not be available in the general production of the Model S. We also plan to offer the capability to fast
charge in as little as 45 minutes at commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future and the ability to rapidly swap out its battery pack at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility to complement its range
capabilities. We believe that the Model&#160;S will demonstrate our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer long-range capabilities and uncompromised performance, energy efficiency, convenience and design. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We are designing the Model&#160;S for a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster. Accordingly, we currently intend to
target an annual production rate of up to approximately 20,000 cars per year from our planned manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. The drivable early prototype of the Model&#160;S was exhibited to the public in March 2009 and the first
alpha prototype was driving before the end of 2010. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had received approximately 3,400 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We intend to develop a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for the manufacture of the
Model S and its components. In October 2010, we completed the purchase of this facility from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). We intend to use the facility for the production of our planned Model S vehicle and to build our future
electric vehicles. We have entered into a loan agreement with the United States Federal Financing Bank and United States Department of Energy (DOE Loan Facility), to arrange loans for up to $465.0&#160;million loan, $363.9&#160;million of which is
intended for the continued development of the Model&#160;S and the build out of our Fremont facility. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The electric powertrain
we developed for the Tesla Roadster has provided the foundational technology for our planned Model&#160;S, our future vehicles and for electric powertrain components that we have begun selling to Daimler and its affiliates and that we intend to sell
to Toyota. Our electric powertrain consists of only four physical components: our modular battery pack, our power electronics module, gearbox and our motor. This component design contains far fewer moving parts than a gasoline powertrain. These
features enable us to adapt it for a variety of vehicle applications. The Tesla Roadster electric powertrain will be the basis of the Model&#160;S powertrain, with design enhancements. Similarly, using the existing Tesla Roadster battery pack, we
have worked with Daimler since June 2008 to develop a battery pack and charging system for an initial trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive vehicle pilot program in at least five European cities. We have expanded this business

by developing and selling additional powertrain components to Daimler and Toyota, and have secured $101.2&#160;million of an aggregate $465.0&#160;million from our DOE Loan Facility to fund the
infrastructure for these powertrain activities. We believe that our efforts in our powertrain development will enable us to advance our technology and rapidly and cost effectively develop vehicles. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on the Tesla Roadster at what
we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. The battery pack of the Tesla Roadster uses commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contains 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other
commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing its range capability. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in
battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design
and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio&#151;as
of February&#160;3, 2011, we had 35 issued patents and approximately 280 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles. First, our battery pack is based on
commodity battery cells placed in modules that we believe will form the basis of later generations of our battery packs, such as those we are developing for the Model&#160;S. Second, we use upgradeable software extensively for managing vehicle
performance and the driver experience. Finally, we are designing a common platform architecture for the Model&#160;S, which compactly positions the battery pack, motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle. We believe
this architecture will form the basis of several future vehicles, including our planned Model X crossover vehicle, and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to
design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, we believe our Tesla
Roadster customers enjoy, and Model&#160;S customers will enjoy, several benefits, including: </font></p> <p style="font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&#160;</p>

electric vehicle available in the United States today. The two-seat, convertible Tesla Roadster has a combination of range, style, performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we
had delivered over 1,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 31 countries, almost all of which were sold to customers in North America and Europe. To date, our customers have driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 9.0&#160;million
miles. The Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from, all applicable vehicle safety standards in the United States, the European Union as well as select other countries. Additionally, we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the
United Nations, United States Department of Transportation and other government agencies, allowing us to ship the Tesla Roadster to a number of countries throughout the world. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster is $101,500 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States
federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. The Tesla Roadster offers performance characteristics that we believe are among the best in the industry. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and
has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. We believe the Tesla Roadster&#146;s lightweight and proprietary electric powertrain provides significant performance advantages over traditional internal combustion engine-powered sports
cars. Specifically, the electric powertrain that delivers peak torque (in excess of 200 foot pounds) at extremely low revolutions per minute, or rpm, and remains near peak through 7,000 rpm of the 13,000 rpm range enables the Tesla Roadster to
achieve its high levels of acceleration. With such a long and flat torque curve, we believe the Tesla Roadster delivers a compelling driving experience with instantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed. </font></p>

our first Tesla Roadster equaled approximately $125 million. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We have continued to rapidly develop the Tesla Roadster since
its introduction. In June 2009, nine months after its commercial introduction, we launched the 2010 Tesla Roadster, known as the Tesla Roadster 2, as well as a high-performance variant, the Tesla Roadster Sport. As compared to the original Tesla
Roadster, the Tesla Roadster 2 delivered a higher quality interior, a new push-button gear selector, improved heating and cooling performance, a more powerful electric powertrain and improved noise reduction. New optional features were also added
including clear coat carbon fiber trim for the exterior and interior, an adjustable suspension and improved vehicle data connectivity via a GSM module. In addition to making these enhancements, we simultaneously reduced our manufacturing costs
significantly by making a number of modifications, including redesigning our power electronics module and switching to certain commodity components in our manufacturing process. The Tesla Roadster Sport offers a higher performance powertrain which
improves acceleration from 0 to 60 miles per hour from 3.9 seconds to 3.7 seconds, adjustable suspension and performance tires and forged wheels, all without compromising the efficiency of the Tesla Roadster electric powertrain. The current
effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster Sport is $121,000 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of
alternative fuel vehicles. We delivered our first right-hand drive model of the Tesla Roadster in January 2010 and have since delivered right-hand drive Roadsters into key markets such as United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. In July
2010, a year after the launch of Roadster 2, we released the Roadster 2.5. As compared to the Roadster 2, the Roadster 2.5 received an upgraded front fascia and front chin spoiler, improved electronics package and double DIN display, redesigned rear
diffuser and improved noise reduction. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The performance and safety systems of the Tesla Roadster and its battery required the
development of sophisticated control software. For example, we have implemented several algorithms in our vehicle control software to reduce the likelihood of unintended acceleration of our vehicles in the event of either a mechanical or electronic
malfunction. We stop the flow of electricity to our motor when either the car is placed in neutral or the key is rotated from the &#147;on&#148; position. We also stop the flow of electricity to the motor during normal vehicle operation when the
brake pedal is depressed for more than two seconds after the accelerator has been depressed. Finally, we have a dedicated processor that monitors the ratio of accelerator position and torque delivered to our motor and will stop the flow of
electricity to our motor if the ratio diverges from set parameters. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>The Tesla Model&#160;S </i></b></font></p>

within the electric powertrain of the Tesla Roadster to create a four-door, five adult passenger sedan that produces zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds. The drivable early
prototype of the Model&#160;S was exhibited to the public in March 2009 and as of December&#160;31, 2010, we had received approximately 3,400 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000. We intend to make the Model&#160;S
available with three range variants&#151;160 miles, 230 miles, and 300 miles, on a single charge, as projected using the EPA&#146;s combined city/highway test cycles&#151;to allow customers to purchase an electric vehicle that best matches their

certain colors and options, some of which may not be available in the general production of the Model S. We are designing the Model&#160;S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats,
subject to applicable safety regulations and requirements, allowing us to offer a seven passenger sedan. The EPA has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe
could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">To complement its
range capabilities, we also plan to offer the Model&#160;S with a package of recharging options, including the capability to fast charge in as little as 45 minutes at commercial direct current charging stations that we anticipate may be available in
the future. This feature would offer consumers a rapid and convenient way to recharge their vehicles. In addition, we are designing the Model&#160;S to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped
out at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility. We are designing the Model&#160;S to offer a compelling combination of functionality, convenience and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in
the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, we are designing the Model&#160;S to provide best in class storage space of approximately 29 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of
comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 BMW 5 Series&#160;sedan and the approximately 21 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 Lincoln Town Car. We are also planning to equip the
Model&#160;S with premium luxury features, including a 17&#148; touch screen driver interface, advanced wireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We are
designing the Model&#160;S with the intent to achieve a five star safety rating. We believe the intended combination of performance, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of the Model&#160;S will help position it as a compelling alternative to
other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We currently anticipate that the base Model&#160;S will have an
effective price of $49,900 in the United States with a standard 160 mile range battery pack, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even
without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive with other premium vehicles. We have not finalized pricing for the 230 or 300 mile range variants of the Model&#160;S. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We are designing the Model&#160;S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the
purchase price, cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives
are still available at the time of a Model&#160;S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of the Model&#160;S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example,
assuming an average of 12,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 11.7 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $2.86 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and
gasoline price in the United States, respectively, for November 2010, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of the Model&#160;S, we estimate that our planned Model&#160;S could have approximately $1,400 per year less in fuel costs than
a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. Furthermore, we expect the planned Model&#160;S will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain
components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Future Vehicle Roadmap Based on Model&#160;S

cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. We maintain an internal battery cell
testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we
expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially
viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics,
testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. For example, a customer&#146;s use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the
frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery&#146;s ability to hold a charge. We currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 60-65% of
its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that our Tesla Roadster would have a
5-10% reduction in range when operated in -20&#176;C temperatures. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of
different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. These battery cells are commercially available in large
quantities. We currently intend to use the same battery cell form factor in the Model&#160;S. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Power Electronics
</i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The power electronics in Tesla&#146;s electric powertrains govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car,
primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack. The power electronics has two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while
charging. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery
pack into alternating current (AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this
function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall
driving experience of the vehicle. For example, the power electronics in the 2010 Tesla Roadster Sport is capable of delivering approximately 900 amps of electrical current in a matter of milliseconds, enabling the rapid acceleration of the vehicle.
We are continuing to make advancements in the drive inverter. The Model S drive inverter, for example, will be able to deliver approximately 1,000 amps of current at better efficiency and lower cost as compared to the Tesla Roadster drive inverter.
In addition, we are also designing the drive inverter to integrate more directly with other components of the powertrain, reducing cost and size while improving packaging efficiency. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall
outlet or other electricity source) into direct current which can be accepted by the battery. The charger enables us to use any available source of power to charge our vehicle. Our vehicles can recharge on any electrical outlet from a common outlet
of 15 amps and 120 volts all the way up to a high power outlet of 70 amps and 240 volts, which provides optimal recharging. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Since the Tesla Roadster charger system is built into the vehicle, it is possible to charge the vehicle using a variety of power outlets.
Charging the Tesla Roadster battery pack to full capacity will take approximately 7 </font></p>

hours using a 240 volt, 40 amp outlet that is widely available in many homes in the United States for electric appliances. A high power connection capable of 240 volts and 70 amps reduces this
charging time to about 4.5 hours. Such a connection can be installed in many homes with the assistance of a qualified electrician. For additional flexibility, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can also be charged with a 120 volt, 15 amp connection.
Using this lower power output, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can be charged to full capacity in about 42 hours. This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle
overnight at home. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">For the Model&#160;S, we plan to offer a high-voltage fast charge option that will enable the vehicle to
charge from higher amperage, DC commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Motor
</i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our powertrains currently use custom designed 3-phase induction motors. We believe we have made several important
innovations in our motor design that minimize mass while still providing high power and efficiency. Our motors incorporate a proprietary fabricated copper rotor design. Our motors also include optimized winding patterns that allow for easy
manufacture and fit in as much copper as possible to reduce resistance and energy losses. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We also use high-quality bearings
and precision balancing on the rotor and shaft to enable the spin of the motor up to 13,000 revolutions per minute, or rpm, in normal operation. Combining this very high rpm rating with an instantaneous stall torque of over 200 foot pounds gives a
broad torque-speed map that allows a single speed gearbox to deliver high vehicle performance. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Gearbox
</i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We have designed a custom, single speed gearbox that is manufactured in-house for the Tesla Roadster. The Roadster
gearbox combines low mass with high efficiency and can match both the speed and torque capabilities of Tesla&#146;s AC induction motors. In comparison to a gasoline-powered vehicle, the elimination of gear changes contributes to the rapid
acceleration characteristics of the Tesla Roadster. We plan to design and manufacture the gearbox for the upcoming Model S sedan. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Control Software </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The performance and safety systems of the Tesla
Roadster and its battery required the development of sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in the Tesla Roadster to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity
between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#147;creep&#148; feeling which drivers
expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Drivers use the
information systems in the Tesla Roadster to optimize performance and charging modes and times. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems.
</font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to leverage our investment in software for the development of the Model&#160;S. In addition to the vehicle control

For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation
and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. In addition, low voltage electric systems which power features such as the
radio, power windows, and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components
that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of
mass on range. The Tesla Roadster is built with an internally-designed carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass. We intend to build the Model&#160;S with a lightweight aluminum body and have been designing the body and chassis
with a variety of materials and production methods that will help optimize the weight of the vehicle. We intend to develop a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Fremont, California to assemble vehicles and manufacture
components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of the Model&#160;S. Our engineering and manufacturing teams are working alongside one another in an effort to accelerate the Model&#160;S development. We believe the co-location

the Tesla Roadster were conducted via the phone and internet, or in-person at our headquarters and corporate events. Increasingly, sales are being made through our network of Tesla stores. Our Tesla stores are highly visible, premium outlets in
major metropolitan markets that generally combine retail sales and service. We intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets. As of December&#160;31, 2008, we had opened 2 stores, which increased to 10 stores by
December&#160;31, 2009 and 16 stores by December&#160;31, 2010. As of February&#160;28, 2011, we had opened 17 Tesla stores in the United States, Europe and Asia, located in Boulder, Chicago, Los Angeles, Menlo Park, Miami, New York, Newport Beach,
Seattle, Washington, D.C., Copenhagen, London, Milan, Monaco, Munich, Paris, Tokyo and Zurich. We plan to open additional stores during 2011, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection
with the planned Model&#160;S rollout. Additionally, we plan to introduce a new store concept in 2011 to enhance the customer purchasing experience and to generate greater visibility for Tesla products in areas of high customer foot traffic. We also
anticipate that we will place greater sales emphasis on the generation of Model S reservations during 2011. We estimate that our store expansion will cost approximately $5&#160;million to $10&#160;million annually over the next several years.

While some customers purchase their vehicles from this inventory, most of our Tesla Roadster customers choose to customize
the appearance of their vehicle. Potential customers who purchase Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification are required to enter into a purchase agreement and pay a nonrefundable deposit, which is applied towards the purchase price of the
vehicle. For vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms, no deposit is required. For our 2011 model year Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification, our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial deposit, which varies based
on the country of purchase. For the Model&#160;S, we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000. Prior to 2010, our reservation policy was to accept refundable reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase
a Tesla Roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications. During the second quarter of 2010, we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for Tesla
Roadsters manufactured to specification. We also occasionally accept refundable reservation payments if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications. We currently require full payment of
the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand. For customers who
have placed a refundable reservation payment with us, the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement. The drivable early prototype of the
Model&#160;S was exhibited to the public in March 2009 and as of December&#160;31, 2010, we had received approximately 3,400 customer reservations for the vehicle. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we held reservation payments for undelivered Tesla

specifically its ability to store electricity over time, is not covered in either the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or the Extended Service Plan. However, within three months of purchasing a vehicle, customers may purchase a one-time option to
replace the battery pack at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle. For customers that select this option, we agree to replace the original battery of
the vehicle with a replacement battery which will store at least 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy. Charges in addition to the option purchase price apply if the customer exercises the battery replacement option prior to the seventh anniversary of

vehicles in Fremont, California. The initial body and chassis assembly processes for our Tesla Roadster occur at a Lotus Cars Limited (Lotus) facility in Hethel, England where our staff works closely with Lotus. For vehicles destined for the United
States, we ship the rolling chassis, which does not contain our electric powertrain and which we call a glider, to our final assembly facility in Menlo Park, California. At our Menlo Park location, we install the full electric vehicle powertrain and
perform a pre-delivery inspection prior to shipping the Tesla Roadster to customers. For European and Asian deliveries, the full vehicle is assembled on-line at the Lotus facility and pre-delivery inspection occurs at a nearby Tesla facility in
Wymondham, England. Pursuant to the supply agreement with Lotus, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2,400 vehicles or gliders over the term of the agreement. We currently intend to manufacture gliders with Lotus for our current generation
Tesla Roadster until January 2012. We intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. Accordingly, we intend
to offer a limited number of Tesla Roadsters for sale in 2012. To the extent we wish to sell additional Tesla Roadsters with the Lotus gliders beyond those we have contracted for, we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with
Lotus. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had purchased approximately 1,700 vehicles or gliders under this agreement. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We intend

We have developed close
relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain electric powertrain components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the
components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. We refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers. To date, we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our
vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our single source suppliers. For example, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for the Tesla Roadster, Daimler Smart fortwo and Daimler A-Class are available,
we have fully qualified only one supplier for these cells. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified and there can
be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative suppliers on a timely basis. Moreover, battery cell manufactures may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles
are not sufficiently safe. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or
engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of
supply for almost all of our single sourced components on a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of the Tesla Roadster, such as the carbon fiber body

for certain components, such as the chassis of our Tesla Roadster, and we refer to it as a sole source supplier. We do not currently utilize any sole source suppliers other than Lotus. Replacing the components from Lotus that are sole sourced may
require us to reengineer our vehicles, which would be time consuming and costly. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently designing and sourcing

funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. For the Powertrain Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and
the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model&#160;S Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and
development of the Model&#160;S and the planned Model&#160;S manufacturing facility. We will be required to maintain, at all times, available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105% of the amounts required to fund such commitment, after taking
into account current cash flows and cash on hand, and reasonable projections of future generation of net cash from operations, losses and expenditures. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Loans may be requested under the facilities until January&#160;22, 2013, and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date. On the closing date, we paid a facility fee to
the DOE in the amount of $0.5 million. Through December&#160;31, 2010, we have received draw downs under the DOE Loan Facility for an aggregate of $71.8 million, with interest rates ranging from 1.7% to 3.4%, for eligible project costs under both
projects that we have incurred from December&#160;15, 2008 through October&#160;31, 2010. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Advances under the DOE Loan
Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance, and will be based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such advance. Interest on advances
under the DOE Loan Facility is payable quarterly in arrears. Advances under the Powertrain Facility are repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on December&#160;15, 2012 (or, for advances made after such date, in 26 equal quarterly
installments commencing on June&#160;15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Powertrain Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September&#160;15, 2019. Advances under the Model&#160;S Facility are repayable in 40 equal
quarterly installments commencing on December&#160;15, 2012 (or, for advances made after such date, in 38 equal quarterly installments commencing on June&#160;15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Model&#160;S Facility will be due and payable
on the maturity date of September&#160;15, 2022. Advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time at a price determined based on interest rates at the time of prepayment for loans made from the Secretary of the Treasury to
FFB for obligations with an identical payment schedule to the advance being prepaid, which could result in the advance being prepaid at a discount, at par or at a premium. The loan facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment with net cash

March&#160;31, 2014, a maximum ratio of total liabilities to shareholder equity. Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are required to fund a debt service reserve account on or before December&#160;31, 2012, in an amount equal to all principal and
interest that will come due on the advances on the next two payment dates. Once we have deposited such two payments, we will not be required to further fund such debt service reserve account. We have also agreed that in connection with the sale of
our stock in any follow-on equity offering, at least 50% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us. Offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers, directors, employees or consultants in excess of the

proceeds from our initial public offering and concurrent private placement to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. This dedicated account can be used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and Model&#160;S
manufacturing facility projects and will also be used as a mechanism to defer advances under the DOE Loan Facility. This will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the DOE loans, but will require us to use the dedicated account to
fund certain project costs up front, which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the DOE Loan Facility once the dedicated account is depleted, or as part of the final advance for the applicable project. We will be required to deposit a portion
of these reimbursements into the dedicated account, in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be
eligible for reimbursement by the draw down of additional loans under our DOE Loan Facility once used in full. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we have $73.6 million remaining in the dedicated account. </font></p>

defaults. Events of default include, among others, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, defaults under or termination of our leases for the projects, a default in the event of a change of control,
including a failure of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman, and certain of his affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to the Model&#160;S Facility, to own at least 65% of
capital stock held by Mr.&#160;Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness, failure to timely complete the projects, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency
defaults and force majeure events with respect to the projects. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of all obligations under the DOE Loan Facility documents, an obligation by us and any guarantor to repay all
obligations in full, and the exercise of remedies by the DOE or their agent. Our failure to make a timely payment could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued the DOE a warrant to purchase up to 3,085,011 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share and a warrant to purchase up
to 5,100 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8.94 per share. Beginning on December&#160;15, 2018 and until December&#160;14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under these warrants will become exercisable in quarterly amounts
depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter. These warrants may be exercised until December&#160;15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in full prior to December&#160;15, 2018, no shares will be
exercisable under these warrants, except in the case of an event of default, which could accelerate the vesting. </font></p>

ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. Currently, the states of California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island
and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these
regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn ZEV credits on each vehicle sold in such states and have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn.

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Several FMVSS regulations that NHTSA has promulgated or amended recently contain phase-in
provisions requiring increasing percentages of a manufacturer&#146;s vehicles to comply over a period of several model years. Those FMVSSs generally allow low volume manufacturers (those who manufacture fewer than 5,000 vehicles annually for sale in
the United States) and limited line manufacturers (those who sell three or fewer vehicle lines in the United States) to defer compliance until the end of the phase-in period. We currently qualify as both a low volume manufacturer and a limited line
manufacturer, and as a result, we are currently exempt from certain requirements, such as some new advanced airbag requirements, the advanced side impact requirements, and certain electronic stability control requirements, until the end of the
applicable phase-in periods. In addition, we have applied for, and have been granted, an exemption from certain other advanced air bag requirements, which applies to Tesla Roadsters manufactured through January&#160;28, 2011. We have filed a request
for an extension of such exemption for Tesla Roadsters manufactured after such date. While that application is pending and under consideration by NHTSA, the existing exemption is automatically extended. Under U.S. law, we are required to certify
compliance with, or obtain exemption from, all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the United States. Based on testing, engineering analysis, and other
information, we have certified that the Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from all applicable NHTSA standards by affixing a certification label to each Tesla Roadster sold. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel
Economy standards, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner&#146;s manual requirements. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our vehicles sold in Europe are subject to European Union safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations, referred to as European
Union Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA), are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. Our Tesla Roadsters are currently approved for sale on a limited basis
in the European Union via the Small Series&#160;WVTA, which permits the manufacture and sale in the European Union of no more than 1,000 vehicles per year. We plan to keep European sales of our Tesla Roadsters at less than 1,000 vehicles per year,
and have no plans to commence testing our Tesla Roadsters for the WVTA to assure compliance with the European Union requirements to permit unlimited sales. Similarly, Australia and Japan have additional testing regulations applicable to high volume
manufacturers. We also plan to keep Australian and Japanese sales of our Tesla Roadsters at a low volume, and have no plans to comply with the Australian and Japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions. In connection
with the planned introduction of the Tesla Roadster in Australia and Japan, we conducted a frontal impact test based on European Union testing standards on the Tesla Roadster in November 2009, which is required for sales exceeding certain annual
volumes outside the United States. While the Tesla Roadster met most of the criteria for occupant protection and all criteria for high voltage safety in the front impact crash test, there were two criteria that were not met in the test. Based on our
analysis of additional compliance options in Australia and Japan, we believe such an outcome should not limit our ability to sell the Tesla Roadster in Australia below certain annual volumes or, subject to compliance with certain Japanese import
rules, have a material impact on our ability to sell Tesla Roadsters in Japan. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires us
to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle&#146;s window. The FTC specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which further requires that we
test using the United States EPA&#146;s combined city and highway testing cycles. The EPA announced in November 2009 that it would develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles. Based on initial indications
from the EPA, we believe it is likely that the EPA will modify its testing cycles in a manner that, when applied to our vehicles, could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30% as compared to the combined two-cycle test currently
applicable to our vehicles. However, there can be no assurance that the modified EPA testing cycles will not result in a greater reduction. To the extent that the FTC adopts these procedures in place of the current procedures from the SAE, this
could impair our ability to advertise the Tesla Roadster as a vehicle that is capable of going in excess of 200 miles. Moreover, such changes could impair our ability to deliver the Model&#160;S with the

We are registered as both a motor vehicle
manufacturer and dealer in the states of California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Washington, and we are licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the state of New York. We are similarly licensed in the District of Columbia as an EV retail store.
</font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent possible, we plan to secure dealer licenses (or the equivalent of a dealer license) and engage in activities as
a motor vehicle dealer in other states as appropriate and necessary as we open additional Tesla stores. Some states, such as Texas, do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell
vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale and all activities related to the sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible
that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the
state&#146;s motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise
prohibit or impact our planned activities. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In jurisdictions where we do not have a Tesla store, a customer may try to
purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states, such as Kansas, have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be
interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of Kansas in order to sell vehicles to Kansas residents. Such laws may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state before we sell vehicles to residents of such states. In some
states where we have opened a viewing &#147;gallery&#148; that is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby
violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. For example, the state of Colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in Colorado. Although we would prefer that a state regulator address
any concerns of this nature by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance, a state could also take action against us, including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities at that location. In
addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to
residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of
the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined
by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured,
the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the
traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for
vehicles before they are available. In November 2007, we became aware that the New Motor Vehicle Board of the California Department of Transportation has considered whether our reservation and advertising policies comply with these laws. To date, we
have not received any communications on this topic from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance that the DMV will not take the position that our
vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. We expect that if the DMV determines that we may have violated the law, it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance. If we are ultimately found to be
in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments. Resolution of any inquiry may also
involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically exercised only in cases of
significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Certain states may have specific laws which
apply to dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payment received from residents in the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated
account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. Consequently, we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of
Washington in January 2010. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers. Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes
could harm our liquidity. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union
relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or
laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and
may change over time. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to licensing laws, specific laws and regulations in each of the states (and their
interpretation by regulators) may limit or determine how we sell, market, advertise, and otherwise solicit sales, take orders, take reservations and reservation payments, deliver, and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in
that state. While we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have Tesla stores, we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in
jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become
even more so in the future. Prior to the introduction of the Nissan Leaf in December 2010, no mass produced performance highway-capable electric vehicles were being sold in the United States. In Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV
since April 2010. We expect additional competitors to enter the United States and Europe within the next several years, and as they do so, we expect that we will experience significant competition. With respect to our Tesla Roadster, we currently
face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche and Ferrari. In addition, upon the launch of our Model&#160;S sedan, we will face competition from existing and
future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive luxury sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. For
example, Nissan introduced the Nissan Leaf, a fully electric vehicle in December 2010 and Ford has announced that it plans to introduce an electric vehicle in 2011. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and
Honda are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">
of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle
that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, it has been reported that BMW, Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault and Volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for
performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United
States market as well. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical,
manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more
extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to
respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle
development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition; however, we have a limited history of operations. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">You must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early stage company with limited operating history. If we do not successfully
address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. We were formed in July 2003. We began delivering our first performance electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early
2008, and as of December&#160;31, 2010, we had only sold approximately 1,500 production vehicles to customers, almost all of which were sold in the United States and Europe. Our revenues for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
were $116.7&#160;million, $111.9 million and $14.7 million, respectively. We have a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business, operating results and prospects. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have derived our revenues principally from sales of the Tesla Roadster and related sales of zero emission vehicle credits,
and from electric powertrain development services and sales. We intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of our planned Model&#160;S sedan electric vehicle which is at an early stage of development and which we do not
expect to be in production until mid-2012. We have no operating history with respect to the Model&#160;S electric vehicle and have not yet completed the component procurement process for the Model&#160;S, which limits our ability to accurately
forecast the cost of the vehicle. In addition, we only recently completed the purchase of a manufacturing facility in Fremont, California to produce such vehicles, and we have not yet completely finalized the full vehicle design or our engineering,
manufacturing or component supply plans for the Model&#160;S. In addition, as of December&#160;31, 2010 our powertrain sales, development services revenue and powertrain research and development compensation have been almost entirely generated under
arrangements with Daimler AG (Daimler) for the development and sale of a battery pack and charger for Daimler&#146;s Smart fortwo electric drive and for the development of a battery pack for Daimler&#146;s A-Class vehicle. Blackstar Investco LLC
(Blackstar), an affiliate of Daimler, holds more than 5% of our outstanding capital stock. In October 2010, Tesla and Toyota Motor Corporation, (Toyota) entered into an agreement to develop a validated electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. Toyota
also purchased 2,941,176 shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction that occurred concurrently with the closing of our IPO. We have also announced our intention for Tesla to receive Toyota&#146;s support with sourcing parts and
production and engineering expertise for the Model&#160;S. However, we have not entered into any agreements with Toyota for any such assistance, including any purchase orders, and we may never do so. There are no assurances that we will be able to
secure future business with Daimler, Toyota, or any of their affiliates. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">It is difficult to predict our future revenues and
appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. For example, during the four quarters of 2010 and 2009, we recorded quarterly revenue of as much as $45.5&#160;million and as
little as $18.6&#160;million and quarterly operating losses of as much as $51.6&#160;million and as little as $4.3 million. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating
results and financial position could be materially affected. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our revenues to date have included amounts we receive from selling zero
emission vehicle (ZEV) credits to other automobile manufacturers, pursuant to certain state regulations. We have entered into two contracts for the sale of ZEV credits with two separate automotive manufacturers. For the years ended December&#160;31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, we earned revenue from the sale of ZEV credits of $2.8 million, $8.2&#160;million and $3.5 million, respectively. Our current agreement with American Honda Co., Inc. (Honda) provides for the sale of ZEV credits that we earn from
the sale of vehicles that we manufacture through December&#160;31, 2011. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had sold credits for 491 vehicles under this agreement and Honda has an obligation to purchase credits for up to 150 additional vehicles that
Tesla will manufacture prior to the expiration of the agreement. We may not be able to enter into new agreements to sell any additional credits we may earn in excess of the current contractual amounts on equivalent terms and if this occurs, our
financial results will be harmed. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>We are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of our electric
vehicles, specifically the Tesla Roadster, in the near term, and our future success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models, and specifically the Model&#160;S. </i></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We currently generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our Tesla Roadsters and the sale of the related ZEV credits. We began
production of our Tesla Roadster only in 2008, and our second planned vehicle, our Model&#160;S, is not expected to be in production until mid-2012, requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction, and may never be successfully
developed or commercially successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to design future models of performance electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including the Model&#160;S,
will become commercially viable. In particular, it is common in the automotive industry for the production vehicle to have a styling and design different from that of the concept vehicle, which may happen with the Model&#160;S. We believe the design
of the early prototype Model&#160;S is one of the key reasons why we have received approximately 3,400 reservations for the vehicle as of December&#160;31, 2010. To the extent that we are not able to build the production Model&#160;S to the
expectations created by the early prototype and our anticipated specifications, customers may cancel their reservations and our future sales could be harmed. Additionally, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved
vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in
the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology. To date, we have
limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing and selling our electric vehicles. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>We anticipate
that we will experience an increase in losses and may experience a decrease in automotive sales revenues prior to the launch of the Model&#160;S. </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the launch of our Model&#160;S, we anticipate our automotive sales may decline, potentially significantly. We currently produce the Tesla Roadster gliders, which are partially assembled vehicles
that do not contain our electric powertrain, with Lotus Cars Limited (Lotus) in Hethel, England. We currently intend to manufacture gliders with Lotus for our current generation Tesla Roadster until January 2012. We intend to use these gliders in
the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. Through December&#160;31, 2010, we have delivered over 1,500 vehicles. We do not currently
plan to begin selling our next generation Tesla Roadster until at least one year after the launch of the Model&#160;S, which is expected to be in production in mid-2012. As a result, we anticipate that we will generate limited revenue from selling
electric vehicles in 2012 until the launch of our Model&#160;S. The launch of our Model&#160;S could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited revenues
from sales of our electric vehicles. The potential decrease in automotive sales revenue for the periods prior to the launch of the Model&#160;S may be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results
and financial condition and our ability to fund operating losses could seriously constrain our growth. </font></p>

currently have any arrangements in place with third parties for the purchase of powertrain components. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with Daimler or its affiliates as Daimler has indicated its intent to
produce all of its lithium-ion batteries by 2012 as part of a joint venture with Evonik Industries AG and has announced it has entered into a joint venture with BYD Auto to collaborate on the development of an electric car under a jointly owned new
brand for the Chinese market. Recently, Daimler has indicated that there may be an opportunity for us to continue supplying electric powertrain components, including battery packs, in 2012 and beyond, but we have not entered into any agreements with
Daimler for these arrangements and we may never do so. In October 2010, we and Toyota entered into an agreement to develop a validated electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4, although our revenues are currently limited to development services and
we may not be able to enter into additional agreements with Toyota in the future. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Our production model for the

<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop, manufacture, market and sell our planned
Model&#160;S electric vehicle. To date, our revenues have been principally derived from the sales of our Tesla Roadster. The Tesla Roadster has only been produced in low volume quantities and the body is assembled by Lotus in the United Kingdom,
with the final assembly by us at our facility in Menlo Park, California for sales destined in the United States. We plan to manufacture the Model&#160;S in higher volumes than our present production capabilities in our planned manufacturing facility
in Fremont, California. As a result, the non-powertrain portion of the production model for the Model&#160;S will be substantially different and significantly more complex than the non-powertrain portion of the production model for the Tesla
Roadster. In addition, we plan to introduce a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding systems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry. Our Model&#160;S production model will
require significant investments of cash and management resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could postpone our ability to launch or achieve full manufacturing capacity for the Model&#160;S, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our production model for the

our Palo Alto engineering facility, and we believe its size may allow us to adapt our internal manufacturing plans quickly. We expect that all these factors will support the timely start of
production for the Model&#160;S. However, because we have only recently acquired this facility and have just begun to implement our manufacturing plans, we may experience unexpected delays in completing the build out of this facility for the
production of our planned Model&#160;S. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank
(FFB) that is guaranteed by the DOE (DOE Loan Facility). Our DOE Loan Facility provides for a $465.0&#160;million loan facility under the DOE&#146;s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM Program) to help finance the continued
development of the Model&#160;S, including the planned build out and operation of a manufacturing facility, and to finance the planned build out and operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility. We intend to fund the build out of the
planned manufacturing facility principally by using existing cash and cash obtained through the DOE Loan Facility. Our ability to draw down these funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. These draw conditions
include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model&#160;S and the Model&#160;S manufacturing facility. If we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the DOE Loan Facility on the timeline
that we anticipate, our plans for building our Model&#160;S and electric powertrain manufacturing plants could be significantly delayed which would materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

mass produced vehicle, our Model&#160;S. We currently have a drivable early prototype of the Model&#160;S, but do not have a full production intent prototype, a final design, a built-out manufacturing facility or manufacturing processes. The
automobile industry has traditionally been characterized by significant barriers to entry, including large capital requirements, investment costs of designing and manufacturing vehicles, long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept
and design stage, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements and establishing a brand name and image and the need to establish sales and service locations. As a manufacturer and seller of only electric
vehicles, we face a variety of added challenges to entry that a traditional automobile manufacturer would not encounter including additional costs of developing and producing an electric powertrain that has comparable performance to a traditional
gasoline engine in terms of range and power, inexperience with servicing electric vehicles, regulations associated with the transport of lithium-ion batteries and unproven high-volume customer demand for fully electric vehicles. In addition, while
we are designing the Model&#160;S to have the capability to rapidly swap out its battery pack, there are no specialized facilities today to perform such swapping. Also, while we expect to be able to achieve a 300 mile range, our ability to do so
will depend on the feasibility and availability of appropriate battery cell technologies and improvements that we are able to achieve in reducing energy consumption. While we may offer this service in the future at our stores, no assurance can be
provided that we will do so, or that any other third party will offer such services. We must successfully overcome these barriers as we move from producing the low volume Tesla Roadster to the Model&#160;S which we plan to produce at much higher
volumes. If we are not able to overcome these barriers, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed. </font></p>

currently expect that our battery pack for the Tesla Roadster will retain approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial

the powertrain. In certain instances, these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery in most modes of
vehicle operation. Our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed.
Accordingly, our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition, we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle&#146;s
acceleration and speed will decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and
ultimately coast to a stop. Despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any
accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a material adverse affect on our business, prospects, financial condition

We plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles over the internet and in company-owned Tesla stores. This model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the United States, and subjects us to substantial
risk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we will not be able
to utilize long established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with
well-established distribution channels. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had opened 16 Tesla stores in the United States,

Tesla Roadsters to customers, primarily in the United States and Europe. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. Implementing our business model is subject to
numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges. We plan to introduce a new store concept in 2011 to enhance the customer
purchasing experience and to generate greater visibility for Tesla products in areas of high customer foot traffic. We do not know whether our store strategy will meet our anticipated objectives and we may incur additional costs in order to improve

industry laws, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or
conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and
untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable
authorities will apply their state laws to our distribution model is unknown. Such laws, as well as other laws governing the motor vehicle industry, may subject us to potential inquiries and investigations from state motor vehicle regulators who may
question whether our sales model complies with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws and who may require us to change our sales model or may prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In addition, decisions by
regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. Such challenges, if successful, could prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to

Roadster and that we expect to experience on the Model&#160;S, there is a heightened risk that customers that have made reservations may not ultimately take delivery on vehicles due to potential changes in customer preferences, competitive
developments and other factors. For example, when we delayed the introduction of the original Tesla Roadster in the fall of 2007, we experienced a significant number of customers that cancelled their reservations and requested the return of their
reservation payment. If we encounter delays in the introduction of the Model&#160;S, we believe that a significant number of our customers could similarly cancel their reservations. As a result, no assurance can be made that reservations will not be
cancelled and will ultimately result in the final purchase, delivery, and sale of the vehicle. Such cancellations could harm our financial condition, business, prospects and operating results. </font></p>

different demographic from that of the Tesla Roadster. Successfully offering a vehicle in this vehicle class requires delivering a vehicle with a higher standard of fit and finish in the interior and exterior than currently exists in the Tesla
Roadster, at a price that is competitive with other premium vehicles. We have not completed the design, component sourcing or manufacturing process for the Model&#160;S, so it is difficult to forecast its eventual cost, manufacturability or quality.
Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to deliver a vehicle that is ultimately competitive in the premium vehicle market. In 2011, we publicly announced the Tesla Model X as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the
Model S platform. We have also previously announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle which we expect to produce at our planned manufacturing facility in Fremont, California after the introduction of the Model&#160;S.
However, we have not yet finalized the design, engineering or component sourcing plans for these vehicles and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring these vehicles to market at a lower price point and in higher volumes than our

results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We intend to design the Model&#160;S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the Model&#160;S to create future electric
vehicles, including, as examples, a crossover/sport utility vehicle, a van and a cabriolet. In 2011, we publicly announced the Tesla Model X as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. However, we have no experience
with using common platforms in the design and manufacture of our vehicles and the design of the Model&#160;S is not complete. We may make changes to the design of the Model&#160;S that may make it more difficult to use the Model&#160;S platform for
future electric vehicles. There are no assurances that we will be able to use the Model&#160;S platform to bring future vehicle models, including the Model X, to market faster or more inexpensively by leveraging use of this common platform or that
there will be sufficient customer demand for the Model X or additional vehicle variants of this platform. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>The

<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even
more so in the future. Some of our competitors entered the market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter these markets within the next several years and as they do so we expect that we will experience significant
competition. With respect to our Tesla Roadster, we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche and Ferrari. In addition, upon the launch of our
Model&#160;S sedan, we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive luxury sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. In
Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV since April 2010. In December 2010, Nissan introduced the Nissan Leaf, a fully electric vehicle and Ford has announced that it plans to introduce an electric vehicle in 2011. In addition, several
manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced
the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, it has been reported that BMW, Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault and Volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles. Several new

performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a
number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Most of our current and potential competitors have
significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products.
Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our
competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, certain large manufacturers offer financing and leasing options on their vehicles and also have the ability to market vehicles at a substantial discount, provided that the vehicles are
financed through their affiliated financing company. We only began offering a leasing program in February 2010 which is currently only available to qualified customers in the United States. We do not currently offer, or plan to offer, any form of
direct financing on our vehicles. We have not in the past, and do not currently, offer customary discounts on our vehicles. The lack of our direct financing options and the absence of customary vehicle discounts could put us at a competitive
disadvantage. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative
fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer
service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and
prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our
competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us
to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and
operating results. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile. </i></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and
financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. For example, according to automotive industry sources, sales of passenger
vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter of 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a
given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and
disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we sell our electric vehicles will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may
also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations,
including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. </font></p>

our performance electric vehicles. </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Over the last few years, the deterioration in the global financial markets and
continued challenging condition of the macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted consumer spending and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our Tesla Roadster. The automobile industry in particular was severely impacted by the poor
economic conditions and several vehicle manufacturing companies, including General Motors and Chrysler, were forced to file for bankruptcy. Sales of new automobiles generally have dropped during this recessionary period. Sales of high-end and luxury
consumer products, such as our performance electric vehicles, depend in part on discretionary consumer spending and are even more exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions. Difficult economic conditions could therefore temporarily
reduce the market for vehicles in our price range. Discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors, including changes in tax rates and tax credits, interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer credit. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">If the current difficult economic conditions continue or worsen, we may experience a decline in the demand for our Tesla Roadster or
reservations for our Model&#160;S, either of which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Accordingly, any events that have a negative effect on the United States economy or on foreign economies or
that negatively affect consumer confidence in the economy, including disruptions in credit and stock markets, and actual or perceived economic slowdowns, may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </font></p>

operating costs. </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including
seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry in general, and for high-performance sports vehicles such as the Tesla Roadster in particular, typically decline over
the winter season, while sales are generally higher as compared to the winter season during the spring and summer months. We expect sales of the Tesla Roadster to fluctuate on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months
in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of the Model&#160;S and other models we
introduce may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact
demand for our vehicles. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We also expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase
significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture our planned Model&#160;S and electric powertrain components, build and equip new manufacturing facilities to produce the Model&#160;S and electric powertrain
components, open new Tesla stores with maintenance and repair capabilities, incur costs for warranty repairs or product recalls, if any, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support
our growing operations. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results
are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If this occurs, the trading
price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Marketplace confidence in our

Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from now, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might
have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will
continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. For example, during the
economic downturn of 2008, we had difficulty raising the necessary funding for our operations, and, as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2008 we had to lay off approximately 60 employees and curtail our expansion plans. In addition, during this
period a number of customers canceled their previously placed reservations. If we are required to take similar actions in the future, such actions may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers and other parties in our

recognizing only approximately $243.5&#160;million in revenue. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had $99.6&#160;million in cash and cash equivalents, which excludes the $73.6 million in restricted cash we have set aside principally to fund the

example, our vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced. While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a
limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our Tesla Roadster. We have no frame of reference by which to evaluate our Model&#160;S upon which our business prospects depend. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. We experienced product recalls in May 2009 and October 2010, both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall
after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the
partially assembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in
the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. Although the cost of the most recent recall was not material, we may experience additional recalls in the future, which could adversely affect our
brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations. Our electric vehicles, including the Tesla Roadster and Model&#160;S, may not perform consistent with customers&#146; expectations or
consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example, our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market. Any product defects or
any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and

performance electric vehicles. However, seven stores have been open for less than one year, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles through our Tesla stores. Going forward, we intend to build separate sales and
service locations in several markets, but to date have limited experience with separate sales and service locations within a geographic market. We will need to open additional Tesla stores with service capabilities and standalone service locations,
as well as hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these centers and act as Tesla Rangers, in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in
October 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers&#146; vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service
requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirement in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We do not expect to be able to open Tesla stores in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside. In
order to address the service needs of customers that are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest Tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla Rangers
to service the vehicles at the customer&#146;s location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers. In addition, a number of potential customers may choose not
to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our customers&#146; service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and
adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Traditional automobile manufacturers do
not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with third party service
providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our
vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our vehicles are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their
conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state. Whether these laws would also
require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of shipping
customers&#146; vehicles to our nearest Tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical
service facilities in their states. Further, certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service. If issues arise in
connection with these laws, certain aspects of Tesla&#146;s service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law, which may harm our business. </font></p>

to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas.
In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily
on the internet, word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses,
including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential
competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop

Although we
complete the final assembly of our Tesla Roadster in our Menlo Park facility for vehicles destined for the United States market, currently we are dependent upon Lotus to complete the initial portion of the assembly process of the Tesla Roadster for
us in Hethel, England and we expect this to continue until we discontinue sales of our current generation Tesla Roadster. The partially assembled vehicles manufactured by Lotus do not contain our electric powertrain and are referred to as gliders.
We currently intend to manufacture gliders with Lotus for our current generation Tesla Roadster until January 2012. We intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders
placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. Accordingly, we intend to offer a limited number of Tesla Roadsters for sale in 2012. We anticipate that our next generation Tesla Roadster, which we plan to launch at least one year after we
begin production of the Model&#160;S, will be manufactured in our own facilities. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the supply agreement with
Lotus, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2,400 partially assembled or fully assembled vehicles over the term of the agreement. If we are unable to meet this volume requirement, we are still responsible for payment to Lotus of the lesser of
(i)&#160;the sum of Lotus&#146; actual incurred costs and an agreed upon profit margin per vehicle up to the minimum volume requirement or (ii)&#160;&#163;5,400,000. To the extent we would like to produce more than the number of vehicles that we
have contracted for, we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with Lotus but may be unable to do so on terms and conditions favorable to us, if at all. In such event, we may be required to contract with another third party to
replace Lotus which would entail redesign of the Tesla Roadster chassis, adjustments to our supply chain and establishment of a light manufacturing facility. The expense and time required to complete this transition, and to assure that the vehicles
and gliders manufactured at that facility comply with all relevant regulatory requirements, may turn out to be higher than anticipated. Entry into any such contract with another third party might also require us to agree to terms with Lotus on which
Lotus would license certain intellectual property rights necessary for the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster to such third party. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find a third party to complete partial manufacture of the Tesla
Roadster on terms favorable to us, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into an intellectual property rights </font></p>

these component suppliers as our single source suppliers. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our single source

for almost all of our single sourced components on a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of the Tesla Roadster, such as the carbon fiber body panels,
which are supplied to us by Sotira 35, a unit of Sora Composites Group, may be time consuming and costly. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, Lotus
is the only manufacturer for certain components, such as the chassis of our Tesla Roadster. We therefore refer to it as a sole source supplier. Replacing the components from Lotus that are sole sourced may require us to reengineer our vehicles,

ultimately found to be in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments.&#160;Resolution
of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program.&#160;In addition, California is currently the only jurisdiction in which we have licenses to both manufacture and sell our vehicles so any limitation imposed

state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer.&#160;Consequently, we established a segregated
account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in January 2010.&#160;There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payments received from customers.&#160;Our

analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.&#160;If our vehicle reservation or advertising practices or other business practices were found to violate the laws of a jurisdiction, we may face
exposure under those laws and our business and prospects would be adversely affected.&#160;For example, if we are required to return reservation payment amounts, we may need to raise additional funds to make such payments.&#160;There can be no
assurance that such funding would be available on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.&#160;If a court were to find that our reservation agreement or advertising does not comply with state laws, we may face exposure under
those laws which may include exposure under consumer protection statutes such as those that deal with unfair competition and false advertising.&#160;Moreover, reductions in our cash as a result of redemptions or an inability to take reservation
payments could also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing.&#160;The prospect of reductions in cash, even if unrealized, may also make it more difficult to obtain financing. </font></p>

equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $31&#160;million over a three year period starting in December 2009. This
exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to California sales and use taxes and that would be used only for the following three purposes: to establish our production facility for the Model&#160;S sedan, to upgrade our
Palo Alto powertrain production facility, and to expand our current Tesla Roadster assembly operations at our Menlo Park facility. If we fail to meet these conditions, we would be unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial

or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect against our vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. For example, while the federal and state governments have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the
purchase of alternative fuel cars, our competitors have more experience and greater resources in working with legislators than we do, and so there is no guarantee that our vehicles would be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to
alternative fuel vehicles in the future. This would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. As another example, government disincentives have been enacted in Europe for gas-powered vehicles, which discourage the use of such vehicles and
allow us to set a higher sales price for the Tesla Roadster in Europe. In the event that such disincentives are reduced or eliminated, sales of electric vehicles, including our Tesla Roadster, could be adversely affected. Furthermore, low volume
manufacturers are exempt from certain regulatory requirements in the United States and the European Union. This provides us with an advantage over high volume manufacturers that must comply with such regulations. Once we reach a certain threshold
number of sales in each of the United States and the European Union, we will no longer be able to take advantage of such exemptions in the respective jurisdictions, which could lead us to incur additional design and manufacturing expense. We do not
anticipate that we will be able to take advantage of these exemptions with respect to the Model&#160;S which we plan to produce at significantly higher volumes than the Tesla Roadster. </font></p>

March 2009 and are no longer dependent on the financial resources of Mr.&#160;Musk to fund our expected growth given the funds available under DOE Loan Facility and the proceeds from our IPO and private placements. Although Mr.&#160;Musk spends

Mr.&#160;Musk&#146;s shares of our capital stock are held directly by his personal trust. Mr.&#160;Musk is currently engaged in divorce proceedings and previously entered into a post-nuptial agreement which provides that the holdings of the trust,
including Mr.&#160;Musk&#146;s shares of our capital stock, shall remain solely his property. This post-nuptial agreement has been upheld by the Superior Court of Los Angeles though such decision may be subject to an appeal. However, we do not
believe that the divorce proceedings will result in Mr.&#160;Musk owning less than 65% of the capital stock held by him as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility, or otherwise result in a material reduction of Mr.&#160;Musk&#146;s holdings of our
capital stock. We do not expect the divorce proceedings to have a material impact on Mr.&#160;Musk&#146;s ability to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We also do not believe that Mr.&#160;Musk would have to liquidate a significant

lithium-ion battery cells, which on rare occasions have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame. </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The
battery pack in the Tesla Roadster makes use of lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptops and cell phones. We also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion cells in the battery pack for the Model&#160;S and any future vehicles
we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into
flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. The events have also raised questions about the suitability of these lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of cell
manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed our battery pack to passively contain any single cell&#146;s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells and we are not
aware of any such incident in our customers&#146; vehicles. We have tested the batteries and subjected them to damaging treatments such as baking, overcharging, crushing or puncturing to assess our battery pack&#146;s response to deliberate and
sometimes destructive abuse. However, we have delivered only a limited number of Tesla Roadsters to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will
not occur, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause
disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage
or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor&#146;s electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the Tesla Roadster, may cause
indirect adverse publicity for us. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims. </i></b></font></p>

The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this
area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a
product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business,
prospects and operating results. We maintain product liability insurance for all our vehicles with annual limits of approximately $21&#160;million on a claims-made basis, but we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover all
potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be
able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy. </font></p>

Model&#160;S, which may delay our ability to sell the Model&#160;S in high volumes in certain jurisdictions. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>We may be

brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We previously experienced product recalls in May 2009 and October 2010, both of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain. In April 2009, we
determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider. In October 2010, we initiated a
product recall after the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. The cost of
fixing this most recent recall is not material. In the future, we may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our vehicles or electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable
federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, voluntary or involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which would adversely affect our brand image in our target markets and could
adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Our warranty reserves may be

reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We provide a three year or 36,000 miles New Vehicle Limited
Warranty with every Tesla Roadster, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service Plan for the period after the end of the
New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty is similar to other vehicle manufacturers&#146; warranty programs and is intended to
cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, battery, powertrain and brake system. We record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs
and actual warranty costs. However, because we only began delivering our first Tesla Roadster in early 2008, we have extremely limited operating experience with our vehicles, and therefore little experience with warranty claims for these vehicles or
with estimating warranty reserves. Since we began initiating sales of our vehicles, we have continued to increase our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience and we may be required to undertake further such increases in the
future. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had warranty reserves of $5.4 million. We could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense. There can be no assurances that our existing warranty reserves will be sufficient
to cover all claims or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs. </i></b></font></p>

October 2010, we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land. The total cash paid was $42.0 million. The purchase totals 210 acres, or approximately 55% of the land at the site, and includes all of the manufacturing facilities
located thereon totaling approximately 5.4&#160;million square feet. We intend to use the facility and manufacturing assets for the production of our planned Model&#160;S vehicle and to build our future vehicles. We are currently in an early stage
of planning and building out this facility. We are required to comply with environmental regulations in connection with our planned Model&#160;S manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. In October 2010, we and NUMMI amended the May 2010
purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits, or emission credits, for additional consideration of $6.5 million. We completed the transfer of these permits in October 2010. </font></p>

which registered an aggregate of 15,295,000 shares of our common stock, including 1,995,000 shares that the underwriters had the option to purchase. On July&#160;2, 2010, 11,880,600 shares of common stock were sold on our behalf and 3,414,400 shares
of common stock were sold on behalf of the selling stockholders, including 1,995,000 shares sold by the selling stockholders upon exercise in full of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares, at an IPO price of $17.00 per share,
for an aggregate gross offering price of $201,970,200 to us, and $58,044,800 to the selling stockholders. The underwriters of the offering were Goldman, Sachs&#160;&amp; Co., Morgan Stanley&#160;&amp; Co. Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Following the sale of the shares in connection with the closing of the IPO, the offering terminated. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We paid to the underwriters underwriting discounts and commissions totaling approximately $13.1 million in connection with the offering. In addition, we incurred additional costs of approximately $4.4
million in connection with the offering, which when added to the underwriting discounts and commissions paid by us, amounts to total fees and costs of approximately $17.5 million. Thus, the net offering proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and offering costs, were approximately $184.5 million. No offering costs were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our
equity securities or to any other affiliates, other than reimbursement of legal expenses for selling stockholders. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">There was
no material change in the use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b). From the effective date of the registration statement through December&#160;31, 2010, we have
used the net proceeds of the offering for working capital purposes, including expenditures for inventory, personnel costs, equipment and other operating expenses. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers </b></font></p>

convertible preferred stock. This convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering (IPO) in July 2010. Beginning on December&#160;15, 2018 and until
December&#160;14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of our the DOE loan facility during the prior quarter. Since the number of shares of
common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value of this common stock warrant liability reflected in other income (expense), net, until its
expiration or vesting. Potential shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the DOE warrant will be excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock until at least such time as we generate a net profit in a given
period. </font></td></tr></table>

We own our sales and service network, and market and sell our
vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet, in-person at our corporate events and through our network of Tesla stores. We were incorporated in Delaware in 2003, opened our first store in Los Angeles, California in May 2008, and
introduced our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. In July 2009, we introduced a new Roadster model, the Tesla Roadster 2, and its higher performance option package Roadster Sport, as well as launched the Tesla Roadster in Europe. On
July&#160;1, 2010, we introduced the Roadster 2.5, with new styling and an upgraded interior. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended
December&#160;31, 2010, we experienced solid performance from sales of the Tesla Roadster, especially considering that the automotive sales recognized in 2009 were driven primarily from the fulfillment of a significant reservations list that had
accumulated prior to and through 2009. Our automotive sales revenues in 2010 were primarily driven by retail store expansion globally and higher sales and marketing activities, higher average selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle
options to our customers, as well as higher average selling prices outside of the United States. During 2010, we continued to expand our presence in Europe and introduced the Tesla Roadster in Canada and in Asia. Our network of stores increased to
16 stores by the end of 2010 and as of December&#160;31, 2010, we had sold over 1,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 31 countries, with sales volume being concentrated in the United States and in Europe. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States for the Tesla Roadster and during the
latter half of 2010, we began offering a leasing alternative in Canada. Under our program, we permit qualifying customers to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or
purchasing it for a predetermined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the individual leases. Lease revenues for the
year ended December&#160;31, 2010 were $0.8 million and are recorded as part of our automotive sales revenue. Approximately 14% of the Tesla Roadsters delivered during 2010 were under operating leases. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We continued to expand our electric powertrain component and development activities with other automotive manufacturers. By the end of
2009, we had completed the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler AG&#146;s (Daimler) Smart fortwo electric drive and were selected by Daimler to supply it initially with </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">
up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in at least five European cities. In 2010, we made significant deliveries of the Smart fortwo battery
packs and chargers to Daimler which contributed approximately $21 million to our automotive sales revenue. Since 2009, Daimler has increased its orders under this program, with the current total order at 1,800 battery packs and chargers. Production
of the battery packs and chargers is expected to continue through mid-2011. During the year, Daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be
introduced in Europe during 2011. A formal agreement for this arrangement was entered into with Daimler in May 2010 and upon completion of the A-Class battery pack and charger in October, we started recognizing revenue from the delivery of
production battery packs and chargers for the Daimler A-Class program, which we expect to continue through the balance of 2011. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2010, we and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles, and
for us to receive Toyota&#146;s support with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for the Model&#160;S. In July 2010, we and Toyota entered into an early Phase 0 agreement to develop an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4.
With an aim by Toyota to market the electric vehicle in the United States in 2012, prototypes would be made by combining the Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric powertrain. We began developing and delivering prototypes to Toyota for evaluation
during the latter half of the year. In connection with this program, in October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics
module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Pursuant to our agreements, Toyota will pay us up to $69 million for the anticipated development services to be provided by
us over the expected term of our performance. We expect to achieve our deliverables through late 2011 or early 2012. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">As a
result of solid sales of the Tesla Roadster, as well as increased powertrain component sales and the commencement of development services revenues from both Daimler and Toyota, total revenues for 2010 were $116.7 million, an increase over total
revenues of $111.9 million in 2009. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We are designing our second vehicle, the planned Model&#160;S, for a significantly
broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster and plan to manufacture the Model&#160;S in higher volumes than our current volumes for the Tesla Roadster. Model S development progressed well during 2010, culminating in the completion of our first
drivable alpha prototype in December. Expenses related to the Model S alpha prototype build, increased production and engineering headcount and other important engineering, design and testing work being undertaken at several of our suppliers to
support Model S readiness, contributed to the $73.7&#160;million increase in research and development expenses from 2009 to $93.0 million in 2010. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Alongside Model S engineering and manufacturing engineering development, we also completed the purchase of our Fremont manufacturing facility in October, which we intend to use for the production of our
planned Model&#160;S and future vehicles. In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility in Fremont, California from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI), which is a joint venture between
Toyota and Motors Liquidation Company, the owner of selected assets of General Motors. In October 2010, we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land. The purchase totals 210 acres, or approximately 55% of the land at the
site, and includes all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon. In October 2010, we and NUMMI amended the facility purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits for additional consideration. The aggregate
purchase price that we paid to NUMMI was $48.5 million, including the operating permits. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2010, we entered into an
additional purchase agreement with NUMMI for the purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and spare parts located at the Fremont facility. This purchase agreement was subsequently amended to include additional manufacturing equipment and spare
parts and in October 2010, we completed this purchase concurrent with the completion of the facility purchase. The aggregate purchase price that we paid for these assets was $16.7 million. The purchase of the Fremont manufacturing facility and

well as the continued growth of revenues through sales of the Tesla Roadster and our powertrain sales and development activities with our strategic partners. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We expect sales of the Tesla Roadster to grow over 2010, but expect some seasonality during the winter months. We have a supply agreement with Lotus to purchase a minimum of 2,400 Tesla Roadster vehicles
or gliders. Through December&#160;31, 2010, we have delivered over 1,500 vehicles. We currently intend to manufacture the majority of our gliders with Lotus for our current generation Tesla Roadster until January 2012, and we intend to use these
gliders in the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. Accordingly, we intend to offer a limited number of Tesla Roadsters for sale in
2012. To the extent we wish to sell additional Tesla Roadsters with the Lotus gliders beyond the number of vehicles we have contracted for, we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with Lotus but may be unable to do so on terms
and conditions favorable to us, if at all. We do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation Tesla Roadster until at least one year after the launch of the Model&#160;S and we intend to perform such manufacturing entirely in our own
facilities. Continued difficult economic conditions, competition from third parties and the planned availability of the Model S in 2012 could result in depressed sales of the Tesla Roadster in 2011. We expect to continue to experience seasonality
for sales of the Tesla Roadster. We also anticipate that we will place greater sales emphasis on the generation of Model S reservations during the second half of 2011 as we work towards the launch of our planned Model S in mid-2012. </font></p>

have significant deliveries and milestones to achieve in 2011. Along with the supply of battery packs and chargers for Daimler&#146;s Smart fortwo EV and A-Class programs, we will also have important development milestones and prototypes to deliver
to Toyota as part of our Toyota RAV4 agreements. Although our current agreements with Daimler and Toyota provide us with increased revenue potential in 2011 from powertrain-related activities, we do not yet have finalized any agreements with Daimler

engineering, operations and manufacturing engineering teams execute on all significant activities will be critical to a timely launch of our Model S in mid-2012. Our progress towards our beta prototype activities as well as readiness of our
manufacturing capabilities, will influence our ability to achieve the manufacturing cost per unit that we are currently projecting. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In 2011, we publicly announced the Tesla Model X as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. We are designing the Model X as a crossover vehicle. We intend to develop a
prototype of the Model X by the end of 2011. The acceleration of the development of future vehicles, including the Tesla Model X, may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through
obtaining credit. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our operating expenses are expected to increase in 2011 as we continue to execute on the Model S program, systematically and strategically expand our sales and marketing activities globally to support the
launch of the Model S, as well as to maintain and support the overall activities of a growing public company. As we continue to make significant investments in research and development and our infrastructure to launch the Model S, we expect to
continue generating a net loss despite anticipated growth in revenues and improvements in margin. Cost control within our operations, especially in general and administrative, continues to be an important objective. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Capital spending for the Model S program is anticipated to be at its highest level in 2011, as we plan to purchase much of the tooling
and manufacturing equipment required for production. Inclusive of non-Model S related investments, aggregate capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $215 million. The majority of these capital investments
should be reimbursable under the terms of our DOE Loan Facility. With this level of capital spending, we can execute on our strategic decision to increase in-sourcing, primarily in stampings and plastics. We have also elected to invest incrementally
in new technologies, primarily in our paint and body shops, to produce vehicles at a higher quality at an affordable cost.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, we are investing in additional plant automation which provides us with the flexibility to expand capacity to produce up to
20,000 units on just one shift. This investment would have a relatively short payback in terms of saved labor and overhead costs.&#160;Additionally, plant automation will allow us to accommodate either higher Model S production or the efficient
introduction of future models. As significant capital investment is required to bring our Fremont facility and Model S manufacturing assets to a state of production readiness, all depreciation of our capital expenditures related to the Fremont
facility will begin with the start of Model S production. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Unadjusted Error in 2009 </i></b></font></p>

stock options. As stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash item, there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">To correct this error, we recorded additional stock-based compensation of $2.4&#160;million during the three months ended June&#160;30, 2010.

We also evaluated this control deficiency in the context of our internal control over financial reporting and based on the magnitude, nature and extent of the error, determined that such deficiency would be considered a significant deficiency. A

preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical
experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ
significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement
presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly,
these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Revenue Recognition </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Automotive Sales </i></font></p>

vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits. We also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components, such as battery packs and battery chargers, to other manufacturers. We
recognize revenue when (i)&#160;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii)&#160;delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii)&#160;fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv)&#160;collection is
reasonably assured. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles. Sales or other amounts
collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Prior to February 2010, we did
not provide direct financing for the purchase of the Tesla Roadster although a third-party lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the United States. Under these arrangements we have been paid in full by the customer at the
time of purchase. Starting in February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options, accessories and destination charges. While these sales
may take place separately from a vehicle sale, they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements. Contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our
revenue, including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements, when to recognize revenue for each
element, and the period over which revenue should be recognized. We are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a stand-alone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales
of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items. Further, we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items, determined by reference to stand-alone sales of such items.

the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles, vehicle accessories and options separately, outside of any multiple element arrangements. As each of these items has stand alone value to the customer, revenue from sales of
vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer. Increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition

contracts with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenue-generating activity. Revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized, the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met
and collection is reasonably assured. Where development arrangements include substantive at-risk milestones, revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractually-defined milestones. Amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the
revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had deferred $4.0&#160;million in revenue

Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straight-line basis. This amount was recognized over the expected life of the
agreement, beginning in May 2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in May 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the
respective milestones. All amounts received under this development agreement have been recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. All development activities under this agreement were

historical data. We review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch
of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly, the adjustments that we record may be material. As of December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009, we had $5.4 million and $3.8&#160;million in warranty reserves, respectively. Adjustments to warranty

stock options is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility.
Further, the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The risk-free interest rate that we use is based on the United States Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon United States Treasury notes with maturities approximating each
grant&#146;s expected life. Given our limited history with employee grants, we use the &#147;simplified&#148; method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants. The &#147;simplified&#148; method, as permitted by the SEC, is calculated
as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our expected volatility is derived from the
historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology industries, because we have no trading history on our
common stock. When making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable
companies. Our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate
the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based
compensation expense, as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate,
an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is
made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">As we accumulate additional employee option data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities, expected lives and
forfeiture rates, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of sales, research
and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We account for stock options issued to
nonemployees also based on their estimated fair value determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. However, the fair value of the equity awards granted to nonemployees is re-measured as the awards vest, and the resulting increase in
value, if any, is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><i>Common Stock Valuation

valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, <i>Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities
Issued as Compensation</i>. The enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis (income and market approaches) or based on a recent round of financing (option pricing approach). The income
approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value. We have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used
venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us, as a proxy for our cost of capital. Our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each
valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business. For example, the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the Model&#160;S business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise
from the U.S. Department of Energy. </font></p> <p style="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&#160;</p>

shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance. We have recorded the warrants as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable and, therefore, may obligate
us to transfer assets at some point in the future. The warrants are subject to re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense, net on the consolidated statements of
operations. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2010, we issued a warrant to the DOE in connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility to
purchase shares of our Series&#160;E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. This convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share upon
the closing of our IPO in July 2010. Beginning on December&#160;15, 2018 and until December&#160;14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of
the DOE Loan Facility during the prior quarter. The warrant may be exercised until December&#160;15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in part or in full, the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced. Since the
number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. Our ability
to prepay the DOE Loan Facility and consequently, the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE warrant, was determined to represent an embedded derivative. This embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the
warrant. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE warrants will vary depending on the average outstanding
balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates, we measured the fair value of the DOE
warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo approach simulates various scenarios and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE warrant over the expected term of the
DOE Loan Facility of 13 years. For the purposes of the simulation, the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us. The total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated
paths discounted to our valuation date. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The significant assumptions that we use in the valuation of the DOE warrant include similar
assumptions used in the valuation of otherwise featureless stock warrants at various simulated stock prices, as well as the interest rate differential between the interest rates under our DOE Loan Facility and market interest rates for companies
comparable to us. The estimated value of our stock warrant requires us to use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stock-based
compensation discussed above. The differential between the interest rates under our DOE Loan Facility and market interest rates is derived from the credit spread data of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business.
As the average simulated value of our stock warrant increases relative to the credit spread of our comparator companies, the fair value of our DOE warrant decreases since the economic cost of prepaying our outstanding loans under the DOE Loan
Facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt, would be lower than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants. Similarly, as the credit spread of our comparator companies increases relative to
the average simulated value of our stock warrant, the fair value of our DOE warrant increases since the economic cost associated with prepaying our outstanding loans under the DOE Loan Facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt
is higher than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants, and therefore, we would not prepay our outstanding DOE debt and we would allow a higher number of warrants to vest. Prior to completion of our IPO, the
fair value of the DOE warrant was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Upon the completion of our IPO on July&#160;2, 2010, this warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance
sheet from convertible preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability. The DOE warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense, net, as the number of
common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting. As of December&#160;31, 2010, the fair value of the DOE warrant was $6.1&#160;million. The relative movements in our stock price as compared to the
credit spread of our comparator companies will result in fair value changes being recorded in other expense, net, in future periods which may be significant. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Excluding the warrant issued to the DOE in January 2010, we have estimated the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a Black-Scholes

warrants outstanding as of June&#160;30, 2010, were net exercised and the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability was settled. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Income Taxes </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We record our provision for income taxes in our
consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items
recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when
certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Significant management judgment is required in determining our
provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that
are consistent with our future plans. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the
foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. </font></p>

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the
ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes, such as net operating losses, based on our
estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax
authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit
by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including
past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate. To the
extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we
still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Recent Accounting
Pronouncements </b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update which
requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an element&#146;s estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. The guidance is effective beginning
January&#160;1, 2011 with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and
out of Level I and Level II fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers. In addition, in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using Level III inputs, a reporting entity will be required to disclose information
about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis. The updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs
used to measure fair value for both recurring and non-recurring Level II and Level III fair value measurements. The updated guidance is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after December&#160;15, 2009, except for the
disclosures regarding the reconciliation of Level III fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance did not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard update
which provides guidance on the criteria to be followed in recognizing revenue under the milestone method. The milestone method of recognition allows a vendor who is involved with the provision of deliverables to recognize the full amount of a
milestone payment upon achievement if, at the inception of the revenue arrangement, the milestone is determined to be substantive as defined in the standard. The guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after June&#160;15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

primarily of sales of the Tesla Roadster which we began to deliver in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as related zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits. Almost all of the revenue recognized during the year ended December&#160;31, 2008, came from

<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">During the first three quarters of 2009, we continued to fulfill reservations for the Tesla
Roadster and we had made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers who had been on our waitlist for a significant amount of time. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue
recognized during the first three quarters of 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009, sales of the Tesla Roadster began more closely approximating the level of orders placed during the
quarter. Consequently, the comparison of revenue for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010 versus the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 may not be meaningful. As such, vehicle, options and related sales for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010 were
more reflective of current demand as compared to the prior year. Similarly, ZEV credit sales which are included in vehicle, options and related sales, were higher during the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as the fulfillment of a significant
number of reservations allowed us to sell a larger number of ZEV credits. The year over year decrease in vehicle deliveries was partially offset by higher selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher
average selling prices outside of the United States. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified
customers in the United States for the Tesla Roadster. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Tesla Motors Leasing, Inc., qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either
returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the individual
leases. Lease revenues are recorded in vehicle, options and related sales within automotive sales revenue and for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, we recognized $0.8 million. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, approximately 14% of
the vehicles delivered during the year were under operating leases. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had deferred revenues of $1.1 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases. </font></p>

since then, we have recognized revenue from sales of the Tesla Roadster in additional countries including Canada, Japan and Hong Kong. For the years ended December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009, 55% and 19% of our revenue from vehicle, options and related
sales, respectively, were derived outside of the United States. All of our powertrain component and related sales were derived outside of the United States. As we continue to expand into additional new markets, we expect our international automotive

March&#160;31, 2010, we deferred the $5.5&#160;million of payments that had been received from Daimler to that point. In May 2010, we executed a final agreement under which Daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion
of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had completed our deliverables under this agreement and for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, we recognized $14.4 million in development
services revenue. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2010, we and Toyota entered into a Phase 0 agreement to initiate development of an electric

Tesla Roadster internationally, where in certain markets, we have experienced higher selling prices; and cost improvements associated with the model changeover from the Tesla Roadster to the Tesla Roadster 2 during the second half of 2009. Gross
profit for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010 was also favorably impacted by the fact that certain of the A-Class development services revenue that we recognized during the year ended December&#160;31, 2010 did not have any corresponding cost of

The significant increase in cost of revenues
was due to the increase in Tesla Roadster sales from which we began to recognize revenue during the fourth quarter of 2008; higher warranty expense; and the model changeover from the Tesla Roadster to the Tesla Roadster 2 as well as significant part
changes implemented to improve the design and reduce per unit costs, for which we recorded charges to cost of revenues in the amount of $1.4&#160;million for excess and obsolete inventory during the year ended December&#160;31, 2009. </font></p>

make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate

any subsequent offerings of stock occurring before the completion of the projects, up to an aggregate of $100 million, to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. This dedicated account can be used by us to fund any cost
overruns for our powertrain and Model&#160;S manufacturing facility projects and will also be used as a mechanism to defer advances under the DOE Loan Facility. This will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the DOE loans, but will
require us to use the dedicated account to fund certain project costs up front, which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the DOE Loan Facility once the dedicated account is depleted, or as part of the final advance for the applicable
project. We will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account, in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund
project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the draw-down of additional loans under our DOE Loan Facility once used in full, or as part of the final advance for the applicable project. Upon the completion of
our IPO and concurrent private placement on July&#160;2, 2010, we transferred $100.0 million of the net proceeds from the IPO and the concurrent private placement to fund the dedicated account. During third and fourth quarters of 2010, we
transferred $26.4 million from the dedicated account to our operating cash accounts in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility. As of December&#160;31, 2010, $73.6 million remained in the dedicated account. As we expect to transfer

<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the United States for the Tesla Roadster. Through our
wholly owned subsidiary Tesla Motors Leasing, Inc., qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined
residual value. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">When compared to our sales of vehicles, our leasing activities will spread the cash inflows that we would
otherwise receive upon the sale of a vehicle, over the lease term and final disposition of the leased vehicle. As such, our cash and working capital requirements will be directly impacted and if leasing volume increases significantly, the impact may
be material. However, after taking into consideration our current and planned sources of operating cash, our ability to monitor and prospectively adjust our leasing activity, as well as our intent to collect nonrefundable deposits for leased
vehicles that are manufactured to specification, we do not believe that our planned leasing operations will materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments and obligations as they become due. As we will also be exposed to credit risk
related to the timely collection of lease payments from our customers, we intend to utilize our credit approval and ongoing review processes in order to minimize any credit losses that could occur and which could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. We intend to require deposits from customers electing a lease option for vehicles built to a customer&#146;s specifications on the same timeframe and under the same circumstances as from customers purchasing our
vehicles outright. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, approximately 14% of the vehicles delivered during the period were under operating leases. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had deferred revenues of $1.1 million of down payments which
will be recognized over the term of the individual leases. Through December&#160;31, 2010, our leasing activity has not had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Reservation Payments </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">A source of our cash flows from operations has
been through our receipt of reservation payments from our customers. Reservation payments consist of reservation payments that allow potential customers to hold a reservation for the future purchase of a Tesla Roadster or Model&#160;S. For our 2010
model year Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification, our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies based on the country of purchase. For the Model&#160;S, we require an initial reservation
payment of at least $5,000. For vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms, no deposit is required. Prior to the second quarter of 2010, our reservation policy was to accept reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a Tesla
Roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications. During the second quarter of 2010, we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for Tesla Roadsters
manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase agreement. However, we also occasionally accept reservation payments for the Tesla Roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to
select the vehicle specifications. For customers who have placed a reservation payment with us, the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement.
The full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle is required only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. We do not believe that these changes will materially impact our liquidity or capital resources. Reservation payments for a vehicle
are recorded as a current liability when received. No later than upon the delivery of a vehicle, the reservation payments collected on a customer&#146;s account are applied against the total purchase price of the vehicle. Reservation payments are
expected to fluctuate as the number of reservation holders on the Tesla Roadster reservation list decreases, while the number of reservation holders on the Model&#160;S reservation list increases. </font></p>

our infrastructure both in the United States and internationally. Since inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately $330.6&#160;million of cash in operations through December&#160;31, 2010. Our cash flows from
operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our
working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Net cash used in operating activities was $127.8&#160;million during the year ended December&#160;31, 2010. The largest component of our cash used during this period related to our net loss of $154.3
million, which included non-cash charges of $21.2&#160;million related to stock-based compensation expense, $10.6&#160;million related to depreciation and amortization and $5.0&#160;million related to the fair value change in our warrant
liabilities. Significant operating cash outflows were primarily related to $177.6&#160;million of operating expenses, $86.0&#160;million of cost of revenues, a $20.1&#160;million increase in inventory, an $8.4 million increase in operating lease
vehicles, and a $5.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $13.3 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $3.5 million increase in other long-term liabilities. Inventory increased to meet our
production requirements for the Tesla Roadster and powertrain component sales while the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities was due to both the growth of our business, as well as our increased manufacturing
and Model S development activities. Operating lease vehicles increased with the introduction of our leasing program in 2010. Other long-term liabilities increased as a result of higher warranty liability from sales of the Tesla Roadster. </font></p>

2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be integrated into an
electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Upon execution of the agreement, we received a $5.0 million upfront payment for which revenue is being recognized over the expected term of our performance. Deferred revenues also increased from our
vehicle leasing activities as we are recognizing the lease down-payments over the term of the operating leases. The increase in accounts receivable was related primarily to powertrain component sales in relation to Daimler&#146;s Smart fortwo
program as well as $2.3 million receivable from Toyota for the achievement of the first milestone under the Phase 1 contract services agreement. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, we received $10.4&#160;million of net new reservation
payments for the Model&#160;S while reservation payments for the Tesla Roadster decreased by $5.7 million. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Net cash used in

The increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable were also primarily due to the growth in our business. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Significant
operating cash inflows for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 were derived primarily from the sales of the Tesla Roadster as well as development compensation related to the Daimler development agreement. Cash inflows related to automotive sales
activity were $88.5&#160;million comprised of $111.9&#160;million of automotive sales, partially offset by a $22.0&#160;million decrease in refundable reservation payments and a $1.5&#160;million decrease in deferred revenues. The decrease in the
refundable reservation payments was due to the launch of the Tesla Roadster during the year ended December&#160;31, 2008. As we continued to deliver the Tesla Roadster to our customers in 2009, we applied the related reservation payments to the
respective customers&#146; purchase cost. Cash inflows from the Daimler development agreement were $13.2&#160;million comprised primarily of $23.2&#160;million of development compensation partially offset by a $10.0&#160;million decrease in deferred
development compensation. The decrease in deferred development compensation was the result of the amortization of deferred development compensation that we received during the year ended December&#160;31, 2008. </font></p>

Significant operating cash outflows were driven primarily by $77.4&#160;million of operating expenses, $15.9&#160;million of cost of sales, and an $18.8&#160;million increase in inventory, partially offset by an $8.8&#160;million increase in

$10.7&#160;million increase in refundable reservation payments and a $4.1&#160;million increase in deferred revenues. Refundable reservation payments increased reflecting new reservation activity received during the year partially offset by the
reservation payments we applied to our customers&#146; purchase cost as we began delivering Tesla Roadsters during the year ended December&#160;31, 2008. Deferred revenues increased primarily from customer payments we collected for certain Tesla
Roadsters that we had delivered but as to which we had unfulfilled obligations related to powertrain upgrades. We received cash from Daimler of $8.6&#160;million for our development efforts during the year ended December&#160;31, 2008 although the
amounts were deferred entirely until we executed a final agreement in May 2009, which is reflected in the related increase in deferred development compensation of $10.2&#160;million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $1.6

for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were denominated in foreign currencies. This is primarily due to the contract with Lotus Cars Limited, or Lotus, in the United Kingdom to manufacture the Tesla Roadster vehicles and gliders
and other parts sourced in Europe. In addition, our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses denominated in foreign currencies, principally in the British pound, the euro and the Japanese yen. This cost exposure is partially
offset by our recent sales growth in these regions since payments for vehicles sold in these regions are denominated in the local currency. This provides a partial natural hedge to our cost exposure in Europe and Asia depending on our sales levels
in these regions. Our battery cell purchases from Asian suppliers are also subject to currency risk. Although our present contracts are United States dollar based, if the United States dollar depreciates significantly against the local currency, it
could cause our Asian suppliers to significantly raise their prices, which could harm our financial results. To date, the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been significant. </font></p>

December&#160;31, 2010. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had approximately $99.6&#160;million in cash and cash equivalents. We are currently selling the Tesla Roadster automobile and are developing the Model&#160;S sedan. To the extent we do not
meet our planned sales volumes or future product releases or our existing cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to fund our future activities, we will need to raise additional funds. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if
and when needed, will be available at terms satisfactory to us, or at all. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the

entered into a loan agreement with the United States Federal Financing Bank and United States Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM), authorizing the commitment from the DOE to
arrange loans for up to $465.0 million. See Note 8 for additional details. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2010, we effected a 1-for-3 reverse stock
split of our outstanding common stock, and a proportional adjustment to the existing conversion ratios for each series of preferred stock was made at the time of the effectiveness of the reverse stock split. Accordingly, all share and per share
amounts for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this reverse stock split and adjustment of the preferred stock conversion ratio.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and our IPO closed on July&#160;2, 2010, at which time we received cash proceeds of $188.8&#160;million from this transaction, net of underwriting discounts and commissions. Additionally, we incurred offering
costs of $4.4 million related to the IPO (see Note 9). </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent with the closing of our IPO in July 2010, we closed a

during the period. As a result, selling, general and administrative expenses and net loss for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 were understated by $2.7 million. The error did not have an
effect on the valuation of the stock options. As stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash item, there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">To correct this error, we recorded additional stock-based compensation of $2.4&#160;million in the three months ended June&#160;30, 2010.
We considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses and trends in operating results and determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported financial information as well as those related to the year ended

with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </font></p>

As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and
liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices
in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market
data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist only of cash equivalents and current restricted cash. Our liabilities
that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of our common stock warrant liability, and previously, our convertible preferred stock warrant liability. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted
market prices or market prices for similar securities. We do not have any Level II instruments, or instruments valued based on other observable inputs. Our common stock warrant liability, and previously our convertible preferred stock warrant
liability, is classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value
hierarchy for our financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows (in thousands): </font></p> <p style="font-size:12px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">&#160;</p>

and vehicle options, accessories and destination charges as well as sales of ZEV credits. Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components, such as battery packs and battery chargers, to other
automotive manufacturers. Sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated
balance sheets. Prior to February 2010, we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the Tesla Roadster although a third-party lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the United States. Under these arrangements, we
have been paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In regards to the sale of Tesla Roadsters, revenue is
generally recognized upon delivery of the vehicle. Concurrent with a purchase order for a Roadster that is manufactured to specification, customers must remit a reservation payment (see Note 5). For vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms, no
deposit is required. Approximately three months prior to production of a Tesla Roadster manufactured to specification, the reservation payment becomes nonrefundable when the customer enters into a purchase agreement. In a limited number of
circumstances, we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the customer if the options do not limit the functionality of the vehicle. This may happen, for example, in an instance where the customer orders an
additional hard top which is not ready at the time the vehicle is delivered. In such cases, we will continue to defer the related revenue based on the undelivered item&#146;s fair value, as evidenced by the contractual price of the option in
stand-alone transactions. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">While sales of vehicle options and accessories may take place separately from a vehicle sale, they

arrangements. As each of these items has stand alone value to the customer, revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer. We record revenue for destination charges
billed to our customers. Revenue from destination charges totaled $1.0 million, $1.9&#160;million and $0.1&#160;million for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The related costs are recorded in cost of automotive

Roadster. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Tesla Motors Leasing, Inc., qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for
a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the individual leases and record cost of sales equal to the
depreciation of the leased vehicles. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had deferred revenues of $1.1 million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive sales and for the
year ended December&#160;31, 2010, we recognized $0.8 million. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Zero Emission Vehicle Credit Sales </i></b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered
for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. These laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply
such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we have earned ZEV credits on vehicles sold in such states, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. Since our only
commercial vehicle is electric, we do not receive any benefit from the generation of ZEV credits, and accordingly look to sell them to other vehicle manufacturers. In order to facilitate the sale of these credits, we enter into contractual
agreements with third parties requiring them to purchase our ZEV credits at pre-determined prices. We recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the credits is transferred to the purchasing party by the governmental
agency issuing the credits. Revenue from the sale of ZEV credits totaled $2.8 million, $8.2&#160;million and $3.5&#160;million for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. </font></p>

36,000 miles, whichever comes first. We refer to this program as our Extended Service Plan. Amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales over the
extended warranty period. Through December&#160;31, 2010, we have deferred $1.2 million related to the Extended Service Plan and have not yet recognized any related revenues. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, within three months of purchasing a vehicle, we provide customers with a one-time option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. We refer to this program as our Battery Replacement Plan. Amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated
balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery packs. Through December&#160;31, 2010, we have deferred $0.9 million related to the Battery Replacement Plan and have not yet recognized any

development of battery packs and chargers to meet a customer&#146;s specifications. Beginning in the quarter ended March&#160;31, 2010, we started entering into such contracts with the
expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenue-generating activity. Revenue is recognized as the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured. Where development
arrangements include substantive at-risk milestones, revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractually-defined milestones. Amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the
consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs of development services are expensed as incurred. Costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization
of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses; once an agreement is finalized, these costs are recorded in cost of revenues. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to 2010, compensation from the Smart fortwo development arrangement with Daimler AG (Daimler) (see Note 13), was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses. This early arrangement
was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage Daimler and at the same time, jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation. All amounts received under the Smart fortwo agreement were
recognized as an offset to research and development expenses, as we were performing development activities on behalf of Daimler, were being compensated for the cost of these activities and could not practicably separate the efforts or costs related
to these activities from our own research and development. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Freestanding Stock Warrants </b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We accounted for freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheets at fair value upon issuance. The convertible preferred stock warrants were recorded as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock were contingently redeemable which therefore, may have obligated us to transfer
assets at some point in the future (see Note 7). The warrants were subject to re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value was recognized in other expense, net, on the consolidated statements of operations.
For our Series&#160;C and other Series&#160;E convertible preferred stock warrants, excluding the DOE warrant, we adjusted the liability for changes in fair value through the completion of our IPO on July&#160;2, 2010. At that time, the convertible
preferred stock warrants were net exercised and the related liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. For the Series&#160;E convertible preferred stock warrants issued to the DOE (see Note 8), we adjust the liability for changes in
fair value until the earlier of vesting or expiration of the warrants. Upon the completion of our IPO, the DOE warrant converted into a warrant to purchase our common stock and the related liability will continue to be adjusted for changes in fair
value until the earlier of vesting or expiration of the warrants. If the warrants are exercised, the warrant liability will be reclassified to common stock or additional paid-in capital, as applicable. </font></p>

In circumstances where we are aware of a specific
customer&#146;s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we provide an allowance against amounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believes will be collected. As of December&#160;31, 2010 and
2009, we determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was required. We typically do not carry accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Concentration of Risk </b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. To date, we have
not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from sales of powertrain components and the performance of powertrain development
services to Daimler and to Toyota (see Note 13). Accounts receivable balances from Daimler and Toyota represented 51% and 42% as of December&#160;31, 2010, and 82% and 0% as of December&#160;31, 2009 of total accounts receivable, respectively. We
perform credit evaluations of our customers&#146; financial condition and, generally, require no collateral. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">A number of
components that meet our manufacturing requirements are available only from single source suppliers. For example, Lotus is the only manufacturer for certain components, such as the chassis of our Tesla Roadster. In other instances, although there
may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices, we could suffer
manufacturing delays, a possible loss of revenues, or incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. </font></p>

Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs based on reviews
for excess and obsolescence determined primarily by future demand forecasts. We also adjust the carrying value of our inventories when we believe that the net realizable value is less than the carrying value. These write-downs are measured as the
difference between the cost of the inventory, including estimated costs to complete, and estimated selling prices. Once inventory is written down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and
circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Adverse Purchase Commitments

related inventory is deemed to be in excess of its net realizable value, we record a provision for adverse purchase commitments. Charges are recorded as a component of cost of sales. We did not record significant charges during the year ended
December&#160;31, 2010. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2009, we recorded charges of $0.4 million to cost of sales. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2008, we recorded charges of $1.0&#160;million to research and development expenses

</b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update which requires
companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an element&#146;s estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. The guidance is effective beginning January&#160;1, 2011
with early application permitted. We do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and
out of Level I and Level II fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers. In addition, in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using Level III inputs, a reporting entity will be required to disclose information
about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis. The updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs
used to measure fair value for both recurring and non-recurring Level II and Level III fair value measurements. The updated guidance is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after December&#160;15, 2009, except for the
disclosures regarding the reconciliation of Level III fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this updated guidance did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard
update which provides guidance on the criteria to be followed in recognizing revenue under the milestone method. The milestone method of recognition allows a vendor who is involved with the provision of deliverables to recognize the full amount of a
milestone payment upon achievement, if, at the inception of the revenue arrangement, the milestone is determined to be substantive as defined in the standard. The guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after June&#160;15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p>

purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI), which is a joint venture between Toyota, and Motors Liquidation Company, the owner of selected assets of General
Motors. In October 2010, we completed the purchase and received title to the facility and land. The total cash paid was $42.0 million. The purchase totals 210 acres, or approximately 55% of the land at the site, and includes all of the manufacturing
facilities located thereon. In October 2010, we and NUMMI amended the facility purchase agreement to include the transfer to us of certain operating permits, or emission credits, for additional consideration of $6.5 million. We completed the
transfer of these permits in October 2010. We intend to use the facility and manufacturing assets for the production of our planned Model&#160;S vehicle and to build our future vehicles. </font></p>

facility decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As NUMMI continues with its decommissioning activities and we continue with our planned construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of
environmental liabilities may change materially. We have reached an agreement with NUMMI in terms of how we and NUMMI will take responsibility for any costs related to governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed

These amounts are
recorded as current liabilities until the vehicle is delivered. For our 2010 model year Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification, our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies based on the
country of purchase. For the Model&#160;S, we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000. For vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms, no deposit is required. Prior to the three months ended June&#160;30, 2010, our
reservation policy was to accept refundable reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a Tesla Roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications.
During the three months ended June&#160;30, 2010, we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase agreement. However, we also occasionally accept
refundable reservation payments for the Tesla Roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications. For customers who have placed a refundable reservation payment with us, the
reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement. We now require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to
the customer. Amounts received by us as reservation payments are generally not restricted as to their use by us. Upon delivery of the vehicle, the related reservation payments are applied against the customer&#146;s total purchase price for the
vehicle and recognized in automotive sales as part of the respective vehicle sale. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009,
reservation payments in the amount of $30.8 million and $26.0 million, respectively, were recorded as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we held reservation payments for undelivered Tesla Roadsters
in an aggregate amount of $2.5&#160;million and reservation payments for Model&#160;S sedans in an aggregate amount of $28.3 million. As of December&#160;31, 2009, we held reservation payments for undelivered Tesla Roadsters in an aggregate amount
of $8.2&#160;million and reservation payments for Model&#160;S sedans in an aggregate amount of $17.9 million. In order to convert the reservation payments into revenue, we will need to sell vehicles to these customers. All reservation payments for
the Model S are fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase agreement. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>6. Convertible Preferred Stock

Department of Energy Loan Facility </b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">On January&#160;20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the ATVM Incentive Program (the DOE Loan Facility). Under the DOE Loan Facility,
the FFB has made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $465.0 million. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $101.2&#160;million will be made available under the first term loan facility to
finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding for the powertrain engineering and the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components (the Powertrain Facility). Up to an
aggregate principal amount of $363.9&#160;million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding for the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility for, our
Model&#160;S sedan (the Model&#160;S Facility). Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project. The costs
paid by us to date for the Powertrain Facility and the Model&#160;S Facility will be applied towards our obligation to contribute 20% of the eligible project costs, and the DOE&#146;s funding of future eligible costs will be adjusted to take this
into account. Our obligations for the development of, and the build-out of our manufacturing facility for, the Model&#160;S is budgeted to be an aggregate of $33 million or approximately 8.5% of the ongoing budgeted cost, plus any cost overruns for
the projects. We have paid for the full 20% of the budgeted costs related to our Powertrain Facility and therefore expect to receive 100% reimbursement from the DOE Loan Facility for ongoing budgeted costs, but will continue to be responsible for
cost overruns. On the closing date, we paid a facility fee to the DOE in the amount of $0.5&#160;million. From February through December 2010, we received loans under the DOE Loan Facility for an aggregate of $71.8&#160;million at interest rates
ranging from 1.7% to 3.4%. As of December&#160;31, 2010, $393.2 million remained available under the DOE Loan Facility for future draw downs. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to draw down funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. We are currently in compliance with these draw conditions. For the Powertrain Facility, the draw
conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For
the Model&#160;S Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model&#160;S and the planned Model&#160;S manufacturing facility. Certain advances will be subject to
additional conditions to draw-down related to the site on which the applicable project is located. Additionally, the DOE Loan Facility provides for the ability to update milestones should a reasonable need arise. </font></p>

maintain, at all times, available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105% of the amounts required to fund this excess over our financing commitment, after taking into account current cash flows and cash on hand, and reasonable projections of
future generation of net cash from operations, losses and expenditures. Loans may be requested under the facilities until January&#160;22, 2013, and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date. </font></p>

acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and enter
into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities, and
(i)&#160;through December&#160;15, 2012, a minimum cash balance, and (ii)&#160;after December&#160;15, 2012, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a limit on capital expenditures and,

required to further fund such debt service reserve account. We have also agreed that, in connection with the sale of our common stock in an initial public offering, at least 75% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us and, in connection
with the sale of our stock in any other follow-on equity offering, at least 50% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us. Offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers, directors, employees or

depleted, or as part of the final advance for the applicable project. We will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account, in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable
project, and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the draw-down of additional loans under the DOE Loan Facility once used in full, or as part of the
final advance for the applicable project. Upon the completion of our IPO and concurrent Toyota private placement in July 2010, we set aside $100.0 million to fund the dedicated account. Through December&#160;31, 2010, we transferred $26.4 million
from the dedicated account to our operating cash accounts in accordance with the provisions of the DOE Loan Facility. As of December&#160;31, 2010, $73.6 million remained in the dedicated account. As we expect to transfer the remainder of this
balance within one year, we have classified such cash as current restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>DOE
Warrant </i></b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued a warrant to the DOE to purchase
up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series&#160;E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Upon the completion of our IPO which occurred on July&#160;2, 2010, this preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to
3,090,111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share. Beginning on December&#160;15, 2018 and until December&#160;14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will vest and become exercisable in quarterly amounts
depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter. The warrant may be exercised until December&#160;15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in part or in full, the total amount of shares exercisable under the
warrant will be reduced. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the warrants will vary depending on the average
outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates, we measured the fair value
of the warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte Carlo approach simulates and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE warrant. For the purposes of the simulation, the
optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us. The total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date. The prepayment feature which
allows us to prepay the DOE Loan Facility and consequently, affect the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE warrant, was determined to represent an embedded derivative. This embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as
part of the warrant liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the fair value of the embedded derivative are reflected as part of the warrant liability re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet reporting date. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">The warrant is recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration
or vesting. The fair value of the warrant at issuance was $6.3 million, and along with the DOE Loan Facility fee of $0.5&#160;million and other debt issuance costs of $0.9 million, represents a cost of closing the loan facility and is being
amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the DOE Loan Facility of approximately 13 years. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, we amortized $0.6 million to interest expense. </font></p>

payment in deferred revenues. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, we received total payments from Toyota of $5.0 million and as of December&#160;31, 2010, there were amounts receivable of $2.3 million from Toyota related to this agreement.

minimum of 2,400 partially assembled vehicles or gliders over the term of the agreement regardless of whether we are able to market and distribute the Tesla Roadster. Based on the foreign exchange rate for the British Pound as of December&#160;31,
2010 and the most recent price per vehicle, the estimated obligation for the remaining purchase is approximately $15 million which will occur through January 2012. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI (see Note 4). NUMMI has previously identified environmental
conditions at the Fremont site which affect soil and groundwater, and is currently undertaking efforts to address these conditions. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed the environmental issues, we have not yet
performed an in-depth environmental assessment on this facility, and we cannot determine the potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination with any certainty at this time. Based on management&#146;s best estimate, we estimated the fair
value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities was determined based on an expected value analysis of the related potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various
environmental conditions that were identified as part of NUMMI&#146;s facility decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As NUMMI continues with its decommissioning activities and we continue with our planned construction and
operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We have
reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0&#160;million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility
and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions, and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0&#160;million for such remediation activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0&#160;million on
our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0&#160;million has been spent on the remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI&#146;s liability to us with respect to remediation
activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and we have released NUMMI for any known
or unknown claims except for NUMMI&#146;s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we have accrued $5.3 million related to these environmental liabilities (see Note 4). </font></p>

reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules&#160;and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&#160;31, 2010, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
